## Requirements

- Dart SDK >= 3.5.2

## Installation

To develop with Daravel, you need to install the Dart SDK. The Dart SDK can be found at [https://dart.dev/get-dart#install](https://dart.dev/get-dart#install).

If you have the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) SDK installed, you already have the Dart SDK.

With the Dart SDK installed, install Daravel with:

```bash
dart pub global activate daravel_core
```
